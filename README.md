# System Monitoring Dashboard

A custom system monitoring and alerting solution built to track infrastructure health, performance metrics, and security events in real-time. This lab demonstrates full-stack observability using Python, Prometheus, InfluxDB, and Grafana.

---

## Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world infrastructure observability stack tailored for system engineers and administrators. It includes real-time monitoring, historical analysis, alerting workflows, and security event correlation.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**: Tracks CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
- **Custom Alerting Workflows**: Sends notifications based on thresholds for performance or security anomalies.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Stores time-series data for long-term performance insights.
- **Security Event Correlation**: Analyzes log patterns and correlates with system behavior to detect suspicious activity.

## Repository Structure

| Folder        | Contents                                         |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/dashboards/`| JSON files for Grafana dashboards                |
| `/configs/`   | Configuration files for Prometheus, InfluxDB     |
| `/scripts/`   | Python scripts for exporting and alerting        |
| `/docs/`      | Setup guides and correlation reports             |

## Example Use Cases (Review)

- Prometheus scrapes metrics from system exporters and custom scripts.
- Grafana displays metrics on real-time dashboards.
- Python alerts via email/Slack when thresholds are crossed.
- InfluxDB stores historical performance data.
- Correlation logic flags high CPU + repeated login failures as suspicious.

## Getting Started: Running the System Metrics Exporter

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install psutil requests
   ```

2. **Start Prometheus Pushgateway** (default: http://localhost:9091)

3. **Run the exporter script:**
   ```
   python scripts/system_metrics_exporter.py
   ```
   The script will export system metrics every 15 seconds. Stop it anytime with `Ctrl+C`.

4. **Prometheus configuration:**
   Ensure your `configs/prometheus.yml` includes:
   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'system_metrics'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['localhost:9091']
   ```
